add category options to each note

BUGS: 
--Long texts look bad on the screen! Optimize.
---center the tasks
-if user deletes for example the task "1" while typing "1", it creates a bug. That element "1" gets added to the array but not on the screen!
you can create the bug above by making the array more important on the code, get the note from the array and then add it to the screen
that way, in the future, you can hold it in the local storage without having any problems
--add margin to the text inside of a li
-line-through is on X
+++DONE Edit the delete button's function - not just display none!!! 

--IF LI HAD 40% WIDTH, DISPLAY FLIX WOULD BREAK THE CODE!! -ALIGN-

FEATURES TO ADD 
-IF A TASK IS DONE, ADD IT TO THE END!!!
you can solve this by getting the notes from the array
do that. then you can remove the task that is done and
add it to the last --it might cause some bugs
YOU CAN create another array of doneTasks!!!
